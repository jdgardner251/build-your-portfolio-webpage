          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>We started a business in 2013 - Aptus Capital Advisors. I had no idea how the next few years would unfold and the world that would open up to us. We're fortunate to have a foundation built that has provided access and experience to and in a market that's massive and full of inefficiency. </p>

           <p>Web devlopment is something that is a passion of mine because I can see how powerful these skills are. Gaining the required skillset is not a one person job.  I've learned that quickly!  I need help to improve my skills and continually learn.  It's very easy to get stuck.  I'm excited to collaborate so I can learn and help others when I have the opportunity. </p>

          <p>Personally, I've outkicked my coverage.  I have an amazing wife and 4 precious kids.  We live in Fairhope, Alabama. </p>
